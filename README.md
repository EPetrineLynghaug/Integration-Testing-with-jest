Integration testing is a critical part of the software development process, as it ensures that different components of the application work together as expected. By testing the interactions between various modules, developers can uncover and resolve issues that may not be visible during unit testing. In this project, we have implemented integration tests to validate that user input is handled correctly by the form functions. Through these tests, we have confirmed that both success and error messages are displayed accurately under different conditions, contributing to a more robust and user-friendly application. Integration testing enhances code quality and provides a safer development process.
